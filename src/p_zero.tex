Consider a liquidity pool with a bonding curve. Show that the price \( P_0 \) of the pool token at a specific point on the curve can be calculated using the following formula:

\[ 
P_0 = \frac{{x_0 \cdot P_{\text{high}} - y_0}}{{y_0/P_{\text{low}} - x_0}} 
\]

where \( P_{\text{high}} \) and \( P_{\text{low}} \) represent the maximum and minimum prices of the pool token, \( (x_0, y_0) \) represents a point on the bonding curve, and \( P_0 \) represents the price of the pool token at that point.

Show that \( P_0 \) is also equivalent to:

\[ 
\sqrt{{P_{\text{high}} - P_{\text{low}}}} 
\]

\[ 
\frac{{y_0}}{{x_0}} 
\]

\[ 
\frac{{\text{y}_{\text{int}}}}{{\text{x}_{\text{int}}}} 
\]

Where \( \text{x}_{\text{int}} \) and \( \text{y}_{\text{int}} \) represent the x and y intercepts of the bonding curve respectively.
