Homework, 9th May

Draw a **precise** price curve & bonding curve pair, depicting the same token swap on both.

- Label all axes (do as I say, not as I do).
- Annotate the price curve with the initial and final marginal prices.
- Annotate the price curve with the initial and final token balance (for whatever dimension you choose to keep).
- Annotate the bonding curve with the initial and final token balances.
- Annotate the bonding curve with arrows to indicate the direction of the swap.
- Include an appropriate caption using the following template:
  *These graphs depict a token swap performed for a system initially comprising [x] TKNX and [y] TKNY, where the TKNX balance is [increased or decreased] by [Δx] tokens and the TKNY balance is [increased or decreased] by [Δy] TKNY tokens. The initial marginal rate is [∂y/∂x or ∂x/∂y], the final marginal rate is [∂y/∂x or ∂x/∂y], and the effective rate of exchange for the swap is [Δy/Δx or Δx/Δy].*

- Use whatever software you like (e.g., Excel, MatPlotLib, Desmos), and send the working file (e.g., .xlsx, .py, link to Desmos) to me (mark@bancor.network) with "TE Academy Lecture 1 Homework" in the subject.
