# Homework Assignment

## Task:
1. Create two systems of two discrete concentrated liquidity pools.
2. The \( P_{\text{low}} \) boundary of the first pool (\( P_{\text{low1}} \)) must be equal to the \( P_{\text{high}} \) boundary of the second pool (\( P_{\text{high2}} \)). This makes the two pools contiguous with each other at this common price boundary.
3. In the first system of two contiguous pools, use only the curve parameters \( x_0 \), \( y_0 \), and \( a \).
4. In the second system of two pools, use only the curve parameters \( \sqrt{P_{\text{high}}} \), \( \sqrt{P_{\text{low}}} \), and \( L \).



The goal is to model two systems of contiguous liquidity pools and visualize their bonding curves, demonstrating how one pool transitions to the other.
