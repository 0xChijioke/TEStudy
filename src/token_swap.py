# Step 1: Define the Token Swap Scenario

# Step 2: Generate Data for Precise Price Curve
# - Create a range of token balances for TKNX
# - Calculate corresponding prices using the precise price formula

# Step 3: Generate Data for Bonding Curve
# - Define the bonding curve function or equation
# - Generate data points for token balances and corresponding prices

# Step 4: Plot Precise Price Curve
# - Use Matplotlib to create a plot for the precise price curve
# - Plot token balances on the x-axis and prices on the y-axis
# - Label axes, add a title, and include a legend

# Step 5: Plot Bonding Curve
# - Use Matplotlib to create a plot for the bonding curve
# - Plot token balances on the x-axis and prices on the y-axis
# - Label axes, add a title, and include a legend

# Step 6: Add Annotations and Labels
# - Annotate the precise price curve with initial and final token balances
# - Annotate the bonding curve with initial and final token balances
# - Annotate the precise price curve with initial and final marginal prices
# - Add arrows to indicate the direction of the swap


# Step 7: Write Caption
# - Compose a caption summarizing the token swap scenario and key details
# - Include information about initial and final token balances, marginal rates, and the effective rate of exchange for the swap

# Step 8: Review
